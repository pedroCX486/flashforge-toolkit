# Flashforge Toolkit

An opensource Flashforge monitoring toolkit made in [Angular](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) and [Node.JS](https://nodejs.org).

- Note: The Node.JS code is *trash*. Don't expose it to the open internet.  

## Development
  
### WebApp:
Run `npm start` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/` or wait until the compiler opens a window. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
  
### API:
Run `npm start` for a dev server with nodemon. Default port is `81`, it'll automatically reload if you change any of the source files (it uses nodemon).
  
## Build (WebApp)

Run `npm run build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. If you wish to run the project inside a subfolder, run the command `npm run subfolder-build` to build it to run under the `\flashforge-monitor\` subfolder in your server. The webapp also has a lot of environment variables you might want to check out beforehand.
